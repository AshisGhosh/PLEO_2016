// PDK File API example
// Very simple main.p and file example. Simple usage of basic file API's.
//
// This is a simple example of how to use Pleo's basic file API. 
// In this example, we demonstrate how to:
//  - create a new file
//  - open and close the file
//  - add a string to the file
//  - validate the file exists and get its size
//  - delete the file and verify that it is gone
//

// Save space by packing all strings.
#pragma pack 1

// Set a consistent tabsize.
#pragma tabsize 0

// Include API functionality.
#include <Log.inc>
#include <File.inc>
#include <String.inc>
#include <Script.inc>

// This variable is used to record if we've already executed the file operations.
